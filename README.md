The maximum diversity problem (MDP) consists of selecting a subset of m elements from a set of n elements in such a way that the sum of the distances between the chosen elements is maximized. 
The definition of distance between elements is customized to specific applications. This problem is known to be NP-Complete.

In this repository, we use different metaheuristic aproachs to find a solution to this problem:
- Greedy
- Local search
- Genetic Algorithms
- Simulated Annealing - Local Search
- Multi Start - Local Search
- Memetics Algorithms
